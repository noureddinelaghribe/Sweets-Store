## Architecture

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)

The Sweet Store app follows the **MVC** architectural pattern to separate concerns and promote organized code structure. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each component:

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. In Sweet Store, models are used to manage the sweet products, user accounts, and orders. Data interactions with the database are handled here.

- **View:** The user interface that displays the data to the user. This includes activities and fragments in the app that present the lists of sweets, shopping cart, and order details.

- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. Controllers handle user input, process it (often interacting with the Model), and return the appropriate responses to the View. In Sweet Store, controllers manage user actions such as adding items to the cart, processing orders, and updating product listings.

This architecture enhances maintainability and scalability, making it easier to develop and manage the app as it grows.

Thanks.
